# Changelog
History changes of Tweak Web Fonts

<br>

### `Latest`
# **Version 1.01**
Fixed a bug with FontIcons:
````
Font Icons were overwritten by our Font overriding feature.
Which made them render as empty squares...
````

# **Version 1.0**
This is the first release.
Tweak Web Fonts runs as a Safari extension that allows you to update font sizes on websites.
I realized as I am getting older - it is harder for me to read webpages on my phone.

I build Tweak Web Fonts to overcome this limitation.

#### What's New
- Supports updating Fonts Size
- Pro version allows users to tweak font weight, line height and kerning
- Pro version automatically update fonts when you visit the site.

#### Bug Fixes
- No bugs yet but I am sure they will come ..
