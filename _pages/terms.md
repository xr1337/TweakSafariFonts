# Terms of Use

Tweak Web Fonts will try its best to update the fonts on allowed website.
However, it may not work on every web site.
For example, if a website shows a pdf page, Tweak Web Fonts will never be able to update the contents of the PDF.
This limitation applies to all static content ( images, pdf ).

Tweak Web Fonts will never alter the content of text.
However, if a large font was set, the webpage may decide to not show the full text and present ellipse.
It is important for the user to know that this cut-off is not intentional.
Web sites have rules that limit text length.

Therefore - we recommend to use Tweak Web Fonts at your own risk.
